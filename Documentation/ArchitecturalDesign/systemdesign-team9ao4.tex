\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection

The purpose of this document is to provide an outline of the entire system of the android application. The diagrams used in this document identify all main elements and components of the system. The intended audiences for this document are software engineers who intended to work on 3A04 android application project and their instructional staff. The document may be edited if any changes took place on the software requirements specification document.

% End SubSection

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
% Begin SubSection
The system will be made available to the general public through the Google Play Store on the Android Operating System. Users will download and use the app to identify cars they spot in their day to day lives. \\
The user will be prompted by the system to pick from a set of categories they recognize. They will pick 3 of the these: car type, a logo, number of passengers or origin. The system will then search based on the information the user provides. Once the system has successfully run the search algorithm, it will present the user with the name, model, make and a small picture of the car. It will present multiple results ordered by match percentage. The user can then select a result and then search for local dealerships in an area that sell the car, or re-perform the search. The system will also hold a history of the 5 recent searches.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
% Begin SubSection
The document contains information about the architectural design of the product. This includes information about the productâ€™s use cases and classes through various diagrams. Diagrams include a use case diagram, an analysis class diagram, the architectural design diagram, and class responsibility collaboration cards. A depiction of the objects, attributes, and relationships is explained as well as an explanation of the interactions of dataflow between objects. Furthermore, responsibilities of and collaborators to classes have been stated in the document. The last part of the document is the division of labor that used to declare how the group members collaborated to get this document done.

% Begin Section

	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{UseCase.png}
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
	\item Input : The user will input information about the car in question. The system will allow the user to navigate through the application using buttons and provide the application with information using text boxes.

	\item Session: When a user opens the application, a session is started. During a session, the process for identify a car and locating leaderships begins. A list of recent identified cars is saved. The session ends when the application is closed, or if the user wishes to start the process over.

	\item Operation: This is an abstract use case. It extends and includes different operations that the application will perform for the user. These entail: Swap experts, Verify result, Identify car, Locate dealership, Sort dealerships, Provide feedback

	\item Modify experts: Will add/remove/swap experts in and out of the identifier questioner.

	\item Verify result: The result that the application came up with will be verified or denied. If denied, application will promt to re-assess the information given and experts used.

	\item Identify car: User will inform application that they are done inputting information. Using all the information inputted, the application will attempt to identify the correct car.

	\item Locate dealership: Dealerships that have the identified car in their database will be listed with information about them.

	\item Sort dealerships: Sort the dealership based on user's request. The dealerships will be sorted by alphabetical order or shortest distance.

	\item Provide feedback: Feedback will be provided by the user and sent to the developer.

% Begin Section

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item The system is based on a blackboard architecture. There are four separate experts who can provide information independently using their expertise. Each expert identifies a different car property. A car search uses the information provided by the experts to search the car database, finding cars which have the identified properties.
	\par
	This architecture structure works well for this system because it is a knowledge based system. Each expert can provide information which is then used to make a decision. Experts can also be added or removed very easily which gives the system flexibility. The experts are independent of one another, giving the system low coupling. An individual expert has one property which it will identify, giving high cohesion.
	\item Structural architecture diagram of the system:

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item {\textbf{Blackboard Subsystems}}
	\par Car Search:
	\par This subsystem uses car properties provided by the experts to find car models in the database which have the provided properties.
	\item {\textbf{Knowledge Source Subsystems}}
	\par Car Type:
	\par An expert which identifies the type of car (Sedan, SUV, Minivan, etc).
	\par Company Logo:
	\par An expert which identifies the company that made the car based on their logo.
	\par Car Origin:
	\par An expert which identifies the origin of the car (North American, European, etc).
	\par Passenger Capacity:
	\par An expert which identifies the number of passengers the car can hold.
	\par Database:
	\par A database containing car models and their properties. The database can be searched to find models which fit certain criteria.
	\item {\textbf{Controller Subsystem}}
	\par Control:
	\par This subsystem can initiate a car search and supervise the overall identification process.
